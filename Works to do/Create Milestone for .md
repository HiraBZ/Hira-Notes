# DISCUSSION WITH MR. HACKNEY ON PROJECT AND MILESTONE PLANNING


Keep track of your progress on GitHub
Create your own personal profile.
When I track your career progress, I want to do so by looking at your GitHub profile.
Learn how to make a github personal profile like everyone else did
Then, add your own career goals up there as milestone / issues.
And comment directly on issues on Repos that you'll be adding to
Please keep track of your progress on GitHubOkay
Also, it isn't a STAR for you, but it is a STAR for one of our businesses.
let's have you step away from personal stars and instead focus on project stars
Daily, you should be commenting, and discussing issues, and contributing to things up on the Github area
Learn how to make a github personal profile like everyone else didOkay sir, I will add it to my task to make my profile look more professional 
If you're working on an Excel sheet, then at least add a comment up on an issue on Github that you're working on Excel & tell us the progress you made there on Github
Look at Lean & see how often we make updates with Lean
You are following Waterfall in how you communicate on a project, which isn't the philosophy we want.
Use the project management system to constantly update what you're doing
Maintain privacy on GitHub
GitHub is public
So, don't say anything over there that shouldn't be made public knowlege
This means when I start working on an issue I should be commenting then meanwhile I am working on the issue. I will be updating on how and what I am doing.  
If they aren't up on GitHub, then it's not organized very well.
I don't want just a chat from you here
I want you to use a Project Management system everyday
And to always use Smart Commits to update waht you're working on & why
The issues should live inside a Milestone
I would rather me & you agree on a milestone
and then agree on 20 issues
and then you get started on the issues
without me needing to check all the time if you're being productive
it's too much micromanagement for me
I just want to check on Github 1x per week & see that you're makign progress on milestones.
Alright. It will be easy for me as well. 
Spend way more time on the structure
I've been asking this of you many times
And the best I ever get from you is a 100 word message you post up here about what you're going to do for the next few hours
It's very scattered and amateur
Learn to respect great project management practices
I've asked this many many times
You need to make the milestone
and then make the issues
and then ask for greenlight to carry them forward
Maybe you already have these somewhere?
So at the moment, I have two milestones to work on. Work on Candidate Application Program HR-related Tasks. 
But you are not discussing it with me
You have a very simple job
I lead a few large companies
Whenever I see you contact here, it's always scattered & never attached to a task I approved previously
Everything with you is verbal only
Never attached to a PM board
If you have 2 milestones, where are they in a PM Board?
And if they already are in a PM board, why are you not commenting on them there & drawing my attention to them daily?
Inside RevelTek I will make 2 milestones Work on Candidate Application Program Complete the Skill Assessment spreadsheet.Read the files from 1-8 Make 90 days onboarding planmake 180 days onboarding plan(All these 4 sub-points will be further divided as they can not be accomplished in one day)HR-related Tasks. Daily HR-related task for example today help Aleem with interviews with the candidateCoachingWrite-up warningsTerminations Onboarding & Trainings.
I disagree with these milestones
90 Day Onboarding is its own milestone
Skill Assessment is its own milestone
180 day plan is its own milestone
Make a markdown file of what goes inside it
And propose it to me
I will handle making the actual milestone
Mr. Hackney90 Day Onboarding is its own milestoneUnderstood. 
These are not your milestones
These are HR Milestones for the entire company
Learn to separate yourself from what the corporation needs
Your job is just to setup the structure
I have said this before
I said I'd hire people and pop them into HR if you accurately put together the milestones
It is only in your head & my head
You stated it clearly above
That is what I want
But why is it in our heads?
Where is this actually written down?
You are too immature to handle large business
If you were mature, you would realize this will take 1-2 years to build.
Rome wasn't built overnight
Today, our goal is to write down our needs
Then, you can only do 1 small step at a time
Okay. Sir. I will work on it and by today I will share the .md file of all the work to be done inside these milestones. 
But 1 small step when you have a clear plan in place.
Throughout your day, you can give updates on how far you made it
and open yourself up to discussion with your coworkers
This is not private info
I will write down the needs and then I will improve them if required after you go through it. 
It can be shared amongst other employees over at Timmsi
Stop asking for approval at the end of your day
and stop promising a huge chunk of work by the end of the day
It's really annoying to hear & it's not agile
Agile is a discussion....
Agile is a messy process
What is the diff between Agile & Lean?
How can you be more Lean?
I will make the notes while connecting more with the peers and coworkers 
I will bring in frequent discussions and comment on the work I will be doing so that I can get a better productive work. 
Work here is a conversation
It is not a task to be achieved.
Work here is organic. It grows. It evolves. It is dynamic.
It must be discussed & planned throughout the day.
A ton of your time needs to be devoted to the planning stage
Remember the 5S conversation?
To properly do 5S, you need to respect Project Management boards
For example I will discuss and eliminate the waste that is present in the document I am working on 
I don't actually need work done.... I just need work tasks organized and put online
We cannot properly do work until we organize the word & structure it
Your department feels chaotic because for the past 6 months, you haven't used 5S everyday
As soon as you login, you need to go through the 5S
You cannot just hop into work
It requires 5S everytime, multiple times throughout your shift.
I will put my energy in bring a proper plan for the research I will be doing.With the suggestions, I will be taking from other employees.  
Otherwise, things will get messy & be depressive, chaotic, and cause frustration.
Ok, bring Fajar into your work and MarMar
So they can see the process & integrate it into how they work, too
We need everyone doing 5S
Everyone respecting GitHub & Lean Agile.
The crew that logs in at my shift have all been learning this.
You lead the literacy campaign for the crew at your shift time.
Mr. HackneyOk, bring Fajar into your workI will bring in Fajar and Marmar in the work.
I'd like to see everyone during your shift updating their GitHub and utilizing Task Management there
If you're simply a role model in public groups, that will start happening
